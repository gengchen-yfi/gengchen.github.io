## Research Interests

My research focuses on aquatic genetics and genomics, with an emphasis on integrating high-throughput sequencing technologies and bioinformatics approaches to investigate the genetic basis of complex traits in freshwater fish.

Current research interests include:
- Fish genome assembly and annotation
- Population genomics and whole-genome resequencing
- Genetic architecture of growth traits and sex determination
- Stress adaptation and immune regulation in freshwater fish
- Molecular breeding and genomic-assisted selection
